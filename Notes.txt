If Channel is public:
	If Link has 1 slot:
		If 2 user enter from Link:
			1st user counted as joined from @username
			2nd (last) user counted to Link's owner
		TG Database Update takes some time, in this time many people can join fastly.
			It will not count to Link owner.	
	If already joined member rejoins:
		Will not count to owner of Link
		Even will not count to other owner's Link

	Now works well: (With second channel)
		If user didn't join from public link yet
		If user 1 time join/rejoin using public link:
			System work as 1st part (everthing mess up, no count to link owners)
Else (private):
	Works fine even joined from other links
	Even pressing join at the same time: says expired


If editLink without member_limit: (both type channel)
	member_limit will be set to number of joined users
